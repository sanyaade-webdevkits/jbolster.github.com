JavaScript's Date object provides a function for getting the milliseconds from the UNIX epoch - `getTime()`:

    var timeStamp = new Date().getTime();

However, there is a handy shortcut that gets the same thing:

    var timeStamp = +new Date();

It makes me wonder if the `+new` shortcut can work for any other JavaScript object but I haven't had a chance to look yet.

**Update**: Apparently it's just the unary operator ([http://xkr.us/articles/javascript/unary-add/][1]). From the article:

> The unary + operator, when used on types other than string, will internally attempt to call valueOf() or toString() (in that order) and then attempt to convert the result to a number. Thusly, the unary + operator can successfully convert many of the native JS types with certain restrictions.
